	abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate all stages of the mRNA life cycle, yet current methods generally map RNA targets of RBPs one protein at a time. To overcome this limitation, we developed SPIDR (split-and-pool identification of RBP targets), a highly multiplexed split-pool method that profiles the binding sites of dozens of RBPs simultaneously. SPIDR identifies precise, single-nucleotide binding sites for diverse classes of RBPs. Using SPIDR, we uncovered an interaction between LARP1 and the 18S rRNA and resolved this interaction to the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosome using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), providing a potential mechanistic explanation for LARP1’s role in translational suppression. We explored changes in RBP binding upon mTOR inhibition and identified that 4EBP1 preferentially associates with translationally repressed mRNAs upon mTOR inhibition. SPIDR has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of RNA biology by enabling rapid, de novo discovery of RNA-protein interactions at an unprecedented scale.}

	abstract = {Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems perform DNA synthesis to protect bacteria against viral infection, but the identities and functions of their DNA products remain largely unknown. We show that DRT2 systems encode an unprecedented immune pathway that involves de novo gene synthesis through rolling circle reverse transcription of a noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Programmed template jumping on the ncRNA generates a concatemeric cDNA, which becomes double-stranded upon viral infection. This DNA product constitutes a protein-coding, nearly endless open reading frame (neo) gene whose expression leads to potent cell growth arrest, restricting the viral infection. Our work highlights an elegant expansion of genome coding potential through RNA-templated gene creation and challenges conventional paradigms of genetic information encoded along the one-dimensional axis of genomic DNA. The central dogma of molecular biology states that genetic information flows from DNA and RNA to protein, with reverse transcription converting RNA to DNA. In the pursuit of understanding how bacteria defend themselves from viral infection, two groups of investigators have found alternative pathways to making genes from RNA that did not previously encode proteins (see the Perspective by Osterman and Sorek). Tang et al. discovered a mechanism whereby a reverse transcriptase uses RNA templates to synthesize de novo genes, leading to the expression of repetitive, nearly endless open reading frame (Neo) proteins that halt cell growth and restrict viral spread. The cryptic encoding of Neo subverts the conventional flow of genetic information and highlights the potential for hidden genes to be unearthed in other biological contexts. Wilkinson et al. found that some bacteria use reverse transcription to copy RNA into end-to-end repeats of DNA. The repetitive DNA reconstitutes a gene and can be transcribed into a repetitive RNA that encodes a toxic protein. Bacteria use this gene-synthesis ability to produce hypertoxic proteins that can protect against viral infection. —Di Jiang}

Here, we introduce SEC-MX (Size Exclusion Chromatography fractions MultipleXed), a global quantitative method combining Size Exclusion Chromatography and PTM-enrichment for simultaneous characterization of PTMs and assembly states. SEC-MX enhances throughput, allows phosphopeptide enrichment, and facilitates quantitative differential comparisons between biological conditions. Conducting SEC-MX on HEK293 and HCT116 cells, we generate a proof-of-concept dataset, mapping thousands of phosphopeptides and their assembly states. Our analysis reveals intricate relationships between phosphorylation events and assembly states and generates testable hypotheses for follow-up studies. Overall, we establish SEC-MX as a valuable tool for exploring protein functions and regulation beyond abundance changes.}

	RNA interactome studies have revealed that hundreds of zinc-finger proteins (ZFPs) are candidate RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), yet their RNA substrates and functional significance remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we present a systematic multi-omics analysis of the DNA- and RNA-binding targets and regulatory roles of more than 100 ZFPs representing 37 zinc-finger families. We show that multiple ZFPs are previously unknown regulators of RNA splicing, alternative polyadenylation, stability, or translation. The examined ZFPs show widespread sequence-specific RNA binding and preferentially bind proximal to transcription start sites. Additionally, several ZFPs associate with their targets at both the DNA and RNA levels. We highlight ZNF277, a C2H2 ZFP that binds thousands of RNA targets and acts as a multi-functional RBP. We also show that ZNF473 is a DNA/RNA-associated protein that regulates the expression and splicing of cell cycle genes. Our results reveal diverse roles for ZFPs in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation.}

	abstract = {Summary
	Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is linked to the reduction of certain nucleoporins in neurons. Increased nuclear localization of charged multivesicular body protein 7 (CHMP7), a protein involved in nuclear pore surveillance, has been identified as a key factor damaging nuclear pores and disrupting transport. Using CRISPR-based microRaft, followed by gRNA identification (CRaft-ID), we discovered 55 RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that influence CHMP7 localization, including SmD1, a survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex component. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) analyses revealed CHMP7's interactions with SmD1, small nuclear RNAs, and splicing factor mRNAs in motor neurons (MNs). ALS induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-MNs show reduced SmD1 expression, and inhibiting SmD1/SMN complex increased CHMP7 nuclear localization. Crucially, overexpressing SmD1 in ALS iPSC-MNs restored CHMP7's cytoplasmic localization and corrected STMN2 splicing. Our findings suggest that early ALS pathogenesis is driven by SMN complex dysregulation.}
