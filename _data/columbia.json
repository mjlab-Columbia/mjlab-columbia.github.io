        "abstract": "RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) regulate all stages of the mRNA life cycle, yet current methods generally map RNA targets of RBPs one protein at a time. To overcome this limitation, we developed SPIDR (split-and-pool identification of RBP targets), a highly multiplexed split-pool method that profiles the binding sites of dozens of RBPs simultaneously. SPIDR identifies precise, single-nucleotide binding sites for diverse classes of RBPs. Using SPIDR, we uncovered an interaction between LARP1 and the 18S rRNA and resolved this interaction to the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosome using cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM), providing a potential mechanistic explanation for LARP1's role in translational suppression. We explored changes in RBP binding upon mTOR inhibition and identified that 4EBP1 preferentially associates with translationally repressed mRNAs upon mTOR inhibition. SPIDR has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of RNA biology by enabling rapid, de novo discovery of RNA-protein interactions at an unprecedented scale.",

While efforts have assigned RBPs to RNA substrates, less exploration has leveraged protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to study proteins in mRNA life-cycle stages. We generated an RNA-aware, RBP-centric PPI map across the mRNA life cycle in human cells by immunopurification-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) of ?100 endogenous RBPs with and without RNase, augmented by size exclusion chromatography-mass spectrometry (SEC-MS). We identify 8,742 known and 20,802 unreported interactions between 1,125 proteins and determine that 73% of the IP-MS-identified interactions are RNA regulated. Our interactome links many proteins, some with unknown functions, to specific mRNA life-cycle stages, with nearly half associated with multiple stages. We demonstrate the value of this resource by characterizing the splicing and export functions of enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH), and by showing that small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U5 subunit 200 (SNRNP200) interacts with stress granule proteins and binds cytoplasmic RNA differently during stress.",

Although this interplay is central for many biological processes, a systematic method to simultaneously study assembly states and PTMs from the same sample is critically missing. Here, we introduce SEC-MX (Size Exclusion Chromatography fractions MultipleXed), a global quantitative method combining Size Exclusion Chromatography and PTM-enrichment for simultaneous characterization of PTMs and assembly states. SEC-MX enhances throughput, allows phosphopeptide enrichment, and facilitates quantitative differential comparisons between biological conditions. Conducting SEC-MX on HEK293 and HCT116 cells, we generate a proof-of-concept dataset, mapping thousands of phosphopeptides and their assembly states. Our analysis reveals intricate relationships between phosphorylation events and assembly states and generates testable hypotheses for follow-up studies. Overall, we establish SEC-MX as a valuable tool for exploring protein functions and regulation beyond abundance changes.",

We introduce dynamic stable-isotope labeling of organoids (dSILO): a dynamic SILAC derivative that combines a pulse of isotopically labeled amino acids with isobaric tandem mass-tag (TMT) labeling to measure proteome-wide protein turnover rates in organoids. We applied it to a PDA model and discovered that metastatic organoids exhibit an accelerated global proteome turnover compared to primary tumor organoids. Globally, most turnover changes are not reflected at the level of protein abundance. Interestingly, the group of proteins that show the highest turnover increase in metastatic PDA compared to tumor is involved in mitochondrial respiration. This indicates that metastatic PDA may adopt alternative respiratory chain functionality that is controlled by the rate at which proteins are turned over. Collectively, our analysis of proteome turnover in PDA organoids offers insights into the mechanisms underlying PDA metastasis.",

Surprisingly, we observed that the levels of several hundred mRNAs are anti-correlated with their corresponding protein products. We show that rather than arising from canonical forms of gene regulatory control, the regulation of at least 380 such cases, or over 8% of all measured genes, involves temporally regulated switching between production of a canonical, translatable transcript and a 5' extended isoform that is not efficiently translated into protein. By this pervasive mechanism for the modulation of protein levels through a natural developmental program, a single transcription factor can coordinately activate and repress protein synthesis for distinct sets of genes. The distinction is not based on whether or not an mRNA is induced but rather on the type of transcript produced.",

        "abstract": "AbstractIn all cells, proteins are continuously synthesized and degraded to maintain protein homeostasis and modify gene expression levels in response to stimuli. Collectively, the processes of protein synthesis and degradation are referred to as protein turnover. At a steady state, protein turnover is constant to maintain protein homeostasis, but in dynamic responses, proteins change their rates of synthesis and degradation to adjust their proteomes to internal or external stimuli. Thus, probing the kinetics and dynamics of protein turnover lends insight into how cells regulate essential processes such as growth, differentiation, and stress response. Here, we outline historical and current approaches to measuring the kinetics of protein turnover on a proteome-wide scale in both steady-state and dynamic systems, with an emphasis on metabolic tracing using stable isotope?labeled amino acids. We highlight important considerations for designing proteome turnover experiments, key biological findings regarding the conserved principles of proteome turnover regulation, and future perspectives for both technological and biological investigation.",
