        "abstract": "RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play crucial roles in regulating every stage of the mRNA life cycle and mediating non-coding RNA functions. Despite their importance, the specific roles of most RBPs remain unexplored because we do not know what specific RNAs most RBPs bind. Current methods, such as crosslinking and immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (CLIP-seq), have expanded our knowledge of RBP-RNA interactions but are generally limited by their ability to map only one RBP at a time. To address this limitation, we developed SPIDR (Split and Pool Identification of RBP targets), a massively multiplexed method to simultaneously profile global RNA binding sites of dozens to hundreds of RBPs in a single experiment. SPIDR employs split-pool barcoding coupled with antibody-bead barcoding to increase the throughput of current CLIP methods by two orders of magnitude. SPIDR reliably identifies precise, single-nucleotide RNA binding sites for diverse classes of RBPs simultaneously. Using SPIDR, we explored changes in RBP binding upon mTOR inhibition and identified that 4EBP1 acts as a dynamic RBP that selectively binds to 5{\\textquoteright}-untranslated regions of specific translationally repressed mRNAs only upon mTOR inhibition. This observation provides a potential mechanism to explain the specificity of translational regulation controlled by mTOR signaling. SPIDR has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of RNA biology and both transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation by enabling rapid, de novo discovery of RNA-protein interactions at an unprecedented scale.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.",

While efforts have assigned RBPs to RNA substrates, less exploration has leveraged protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to study proteins in mRNA life-cycle stages. We generated an RNA-aware, RBP-centric PPI map across the mRNA life cycle in human cells by immunopurification-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) of ?100 endogenous RBPs with and without RNase, augmented by size exclusion chromatography-mass spectrometry (SEC-MS). We identify 8,742 known and 20,802 unreported interactions between 1,125 proteins and determine that 73{\\%} of the IP-MS-identified interactions are RNA regulated. Our interactome links many proteins, some with unknown functions, to specific mRNA life-cycle stages, with nearly half associated with multiple stages. We demonstrate the value of this resource by characterizing the splicing and export functions of enhancer of rudimentary homolog (ERH), and by showing that small nuclear ribonucleoprotein U5 subunit 200 (SNRNP200) interacts with stress granule proteins and binds cytoplasmic RNA differently during stress.",

Collectively, the processes of protein synthesis and degradation are referred to as protein turnover. At a steady state, protein turnover is constant to maintain protein homeostasis, but in dynamic responses, proteins change their rates of synthesis and degradation to adjust their proteomes to internal or external stimuli. Thus, probing the kinetics and dynamics of protein turnover lends insight into how cells regulate essential processes such as growth, differentiation, and stress response. Here, we outline historical and current approaches to measuring the kinetics of protein turnover on a proteome-wide scale in both steady-state and dynamic systems, with an emphasis on metabolic tracing using stable isotope?labeled amino acids. We highlight important considerations for designing proteome turnover experiments, key biological findings regarding the conserved principles of proteome turnover regulation, and future perspectives for both technological and biological investigation.",

We introduce dynamic stable-isotope labeling of organoids (dSILO): a dynamic SILAC derivative that combines a pulse of isotopically labeled amino acids with isobaric tandem mass-tag (TMT) labeling to measure proteome-wide protein turnover rates in organoids. We applied it to a PDA model and discovered that metastatic organoids exhibit an accelerated global proteome turnover compared to primary tumor organoids. Globally, most turnover changes are not reflected at the level of protein abundance. Interestingly, the group of proteins that show the highest turnover increase in metastatic PDA compared to tumor is involved in mitochondrial respiration. This indicates that metastatic PDA may adopt alternative respiratory chain functionality that is controlled by the rate at which proteins are turned over. Collectively, our analysis of proteome turnover in PDA organoids offers insights into the mechanisms underlying PDA metastasis.",

        "abstract": "Defense-associated reverse transcriptase (DRT) systems perform DNA synthesis to protect bacteria against viral infection, but the identities and functions of their DNA products remain largely unknown. We show that DRT2 systems encode an unprecedented immune pathway that involves de novo gene synthesis through rolling circle reverse transcription of a noncoding RNA (ncRNA). Programmed template jumping on the ncRNA generates a concatemeric cDNA, which becomes double-stranded upon viral infection. This DNA product constitutes a protein-coding, nearly endless open reading frame (neo) gene whose expression leads to potent cell growth arrest, restricting the viral infection. Our work highlights an elegant expansion of genome coding potential through RNA-templated gene creation and challenges conventional paradigms of genetic information encoded along the one-dimensional axis of genomic DNA. The central dogma of molecular biology states that genetic information flows from DNA and RNA to protein, with reverse transcription converting RNA to DNA. In the pursuit of understanding how bacteria defend themselves from viral infection, two groups of investigators have found alternative pathways to making genes from RNA that did not previously encode proteins (see the Perspective by Osterman and Sorek). Tang et al. discovered a mechanism whereby a reverse transcriptase uses RNA templates to synthesize de novo genes, leading to the expression of repetitive, nearly endless open reading frame (Neo) proteins that halt cell growth and restrict viral spread. The cryptic encoding of Neo subverts the conventional flow of genetic information and highlights the potential for hidden genes to be unearthed in other biological contexts. Wilkinson et al. found that some bacteria use reverse transcription to copy RNA into end-to-end repeats of DNA. The repetitive DNA reconstitutes a gene and can be transcribed into a repetitive RNA that encodes a toxic protein. Bacteria use this gene-synthesis ability to produce hypertoxic proteins that can protect against viral infection. \u2014Di Jiang",

        "abstract": "A protein\u2019s molecular interactions and post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, can be co-dependent and reciprocally co-regulate each other. Although this interplay is central for many biological processes, a systematic method to simultaneously study assembly states and PTMs from the same sample is critically missing. Here, we introduce SEC-MX (Size Exclusion Chromatography fractions MultipleXed), a global quantitative method combining Size Exclusion Chromatography and PTM-enrichment for simultaneous characterization of PTMs and assembly states. SEC-MX enhances throughput, allows phosphopeptide enrichment, and facilitates quantitative differential comparisons between biological conditions. Conducting SEC-MX on HEK293 and HCT116 cells, we generate a proof-of-concept dataset, mapping thousands of phosphopeptides and their assembly states. Our analysis reveals intricate relationships between phosphorylation events and assembly states and generates testable hypotheses for follow-up studies. Overall, we establish SEC-MX as a valuable tool for exploring protein functions and regulation beyond abundance changes.",
