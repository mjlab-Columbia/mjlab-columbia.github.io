### About the Lab

Welcome to the laboratory of Marko Jovanovic in the Department of Biological Sciences at Columbia University!

Our research is driven by the goal of understanding how post-transcriptional regulation shapes gene expression dynamics between cellular states. We focus particularly on RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) as key coordinators of these processes, investigating their roles in diverse biological systems including immune responses in dendritic cells, embryonic stem cell differentiation, yeast meiosis, and brain aging. 

To study gene regulation as scale, our lab focuses on the development and application of methodology. We specialize in high-throughput, multi-omics approaches that integrate transcriptomic and proteomic data to provide a large-scale view of post-transcriptional control. With an emphasis on proteomics, we are actively working on novel tools to map dynamic protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions. By integrating systems-level discovery with functional analysis, we aim to uncover the principles and mechanisms that govern cell state changes, stress adaptation, and developmental pathways.
