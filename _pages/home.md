### About the Lab

Welcome to the laboratory of Marko Jovanovic in the Department of Biological Sciences at Columbia University!

We are broadly interested in understanding the principles and mechanisms by which translational regulation controls the dynamics of gene expression and therefore affects processes like differentiation, stress response and pathogenesis. Please do have a look at our website to find out more about the lab and our research.
