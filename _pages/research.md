# Research

At the Jovanovic Lab at Columbia University, we study how cells control gene expression after transcription, with a particular focus on how mRNA is translated into protein. We are interested in the regulatory roles that RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and ribosomes play in this process, especially as they relate to cellular differentiation, stress response, and disease. Recently, our work centers on two key areas.

RNA-Binding Proteins (RBPs): We systematically identify and characterize RBPs that modulate translation. Using high-throughput a method we developed called SPIDR, which performs multiplexed eCLIP assays, we map RNA-binding proteins to their mRNA targets to understand how they influence protein synthesis.

Proteomics and Post-Translational Modifications: We develop and apply proteomic methods such as SEC-MX (Size Exclusion Chromatography fractions MultipleXed) to explore how proteins assemble into complexes and how phosphorylation and other modifications alter their function.

By combining experimental and computational approaches, our lab seeks to uncover fundamental principles of post-transcriptional gene regulation. Our goal is to provide a clearer picture of how proteins are made and regulated in diverse cellular contexts, with implications for understanding development, adaptation, and disease.
