I am a senior from Seattle, Washington, currently pursuing a major in Biology on the pre-medical track. In January 2022, I joined the Jovanovic Lab, where I worked with Lauren Tang to study the transcriptional regulation of genes in Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma between primary tumors and liver metastases. For my research work, I received the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) in 2022 and have since been involved in optimizing proteomic protocols for efficient protein identification and quantification.
Apart from my academic pursuits, I am also the captain of the Columbia Women's Swim and Dive team, and I enjoy exploring New York City's culinary scene in my free time.
