  - B.A. Biochemistry, Columbia University (2020)
---

I graduated from Columbia University with a B.A. in Biochemistry in December 2020. From September 2018 to December 2019, I worked with Martin Chalfie on large scale genetics and drug responses in C. elegans. I was awarded a Genentech Fellowship for undergraduate research during my time in the Chalfie Lab. In January 2020, I joined the Jovanovic Lab, where I worked with Alison Ross to develop and optimize a technology to monitor dynamic protein networks. I aim to continue working on this technology, as well as learn more about mass spectrometry-based proteomics in the contexts of cell differentiation and pathogenesis.
