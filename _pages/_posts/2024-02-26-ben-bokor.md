I graduated from Florida International University in 2019 with a B.S. in Biochemistry, where I developed mass spectrometry protocols for peptide sequencing in Dr. Lima's lab. Currently, my research advances size exclusion chromatography and mass spectrometry methods to investigate protein assembly and interaction dynamics. This involves protocol development, sample preparation, and computational analysis in systems biology and proteomics. When I’m not in the lab, I’m either finding ways to procrastinate or wondering where all my free time went. Feel free to reach out—coffee is on me!
