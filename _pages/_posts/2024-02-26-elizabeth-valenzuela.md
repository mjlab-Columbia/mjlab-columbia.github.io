I worked on the development and optimization of SPIDR - a multiplexed method to create high-throughput binding maps for RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). My current focus is improving the number of antibody beads we can get per aliquot and understand what factors limit the number of beads we can get. I'll be starting my PhD in the fall of 2025 at NYU.
