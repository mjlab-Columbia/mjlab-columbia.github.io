I am a senior at Columbia University, originally from Istanbul, Turkey, majoring in Biological Sciences (BA) on the pre-medical track. I joined the lab in January 2022, where I worked with Alison Ross on optimizing the CITY-seq method for detecting protein-protein interactions. I continued this work as a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF). Recently, I have shifted to a project that aims to identify true interactors through varying antibody concentrations in single immunopurification coupled with mass spectrometry (IP-MS) experiments. Alongside research, during my time at Columbia, I was involved in teaching as an undergraduate Teaching Assistant for Intro Bio I, II, and Molecular Biology. Upon graduation, I will join the Cancer Proteomics and Cell Signaling Group at the Broad Institute as a Research Assistant. Besides academics, I am a huge musical theatre nerd, singer, foodie, and runner.
