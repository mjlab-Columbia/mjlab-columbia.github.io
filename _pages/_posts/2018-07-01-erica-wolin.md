I graduated from the University of Michigan with a B.S. in Neuroscience, where my undergraduate research focused on the consequences of age on the permeability of the blood brain barrier. After graduation, I went on to study somatic stem cell biology for two years as a research assistant at Harvard University. I later joined the Jovanovic lab as a graduate student in July 2018 where I subsequently spent my PhD developing SPIDR, a highly multiplexed CLIP-based method to study RNA protein interactions.
