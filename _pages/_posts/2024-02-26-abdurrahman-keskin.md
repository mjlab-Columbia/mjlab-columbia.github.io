I graduated from Middle East Technical University with a B.S. in Molecular Biology and Genetics in 2013. I then completed my M.S. in Molecular Biology in the Dunn lab at Koç University, where I studied protein targeting to mitochondria in S. cerevisiae. In 2017, I joined the Jovanovic lab as a PhD student, where my research focused on translational regulation in the 5' UTR, specifically investigating gene regulatory mechanisms mediated by mRNA transcript isoform switching during mammalian development. After completing my PhD, I continued my research as a postdoctoral researcher in the Jovanovic lab.
