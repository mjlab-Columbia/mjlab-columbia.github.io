Hi there! I work on bioinformatics and computational analyses within the Jovanovic Lab. Right now, I'm addressing some reviewer comments and developing a robust analysis pipeline for our highly multiplexed CLIP-seq method called SPIDR. The goal of the pipeline is to improve performance and account for variance in the input files (e.g. different bead oligonucleotide structures). Beyond SPIDR, work with other students/postdocs on their projects. I worked with Alison Ross on dSILO, a project that looked at differential protein turnover in a PDAC organoid model. I'm also working with Ella Doron on SEC-SILAM where we're investigating differential protein turnover across assembly states (i.e. assembled versus monomeric proteins). My long term career goal is to simulate a cell but we'll see how well that goes.
