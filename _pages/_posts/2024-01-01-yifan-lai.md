I graduated with a B.A. in Global Public Health and Anthropology from New York University, where I served as a Presidential Intern at the Provost's Office and received the Public Health Research Award. During my undergraduate years, my research primarily focused on understanding HIV/AIDS care at the population level. In Spring 2023, I began my Postbac Premed studies at Columbia, where my Biology classes sparked my interest in Mass Spectrometry (MS) and its application in proteomics and medical research. I joined the Jovanovic lab in January 2024 and am currently working on developing programs to optimize MS analyses for investigating protein-protein interactions.
