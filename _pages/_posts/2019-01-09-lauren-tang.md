Originally from northern New Jersey, I attended Northeastern University for my undergraduate studies, majoring in Biochemistry. During my time at Northeastern, I worked as a co-op student for the Analytical Chemistry team within the Oncology Chemistry group at Millennium Pharmaceuticals. There, I got my first experience with mass-spectrometry. After graduating from Northeastern, I worked at the Broad Institute as a member of the Proteomics Platform. I worked on multiple proteogenomic projects with an aim to characterize diseases, such as breast cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, using mass-spectrometry based proteomics. Looking beyond global proteome profiles, I have also taken interest into studying various post-translational modifications in the context of such diseases. Additionally, I have focused on developing methods to optimize the accuracy and reproducibility of mass-spectrometry based proteomics. Here, in the Jovanovic Lab, I continue to explore different disease states using mass-spectrometry based proteomics.
