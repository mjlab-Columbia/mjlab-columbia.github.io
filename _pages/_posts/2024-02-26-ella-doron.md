I completed my undergrad studies in the neuroscience research program at Tel-Aviv University, where I developed a fascination with neurons and their unique cellular and molecular biology. I then joined the Fainzilber lab at the Weizmann Institute of Science for my graduate studies, exploring mechanisms of axonal transport, in the context of injury signaling and cell-length sensing. For my postdoctoral research, I joined the Jovanovic lab, where I employ data-driven ‘omics’ approaches to investigate the correlations between protein assembly states, post-translational modifications, and protein turnover. My work centers on understanding how these dynamic protein properties and their interplay change during aging. I am co-mentored by Rob Singer at Einstein College of Medicine.
