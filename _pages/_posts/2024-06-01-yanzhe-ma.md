I graduated with a B.S. in Biochemistry and Cell Biology from UC San Diego, with a minor in Applied Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research in Dr. Enfu Hui’s lab, focusing on the cell biological mechanisms of immune checkpoint proteins. I then pursued a Master’s degree in Biotechnology at Columbia University, where I engaged in a protein-protein interaction study using quantitative mass spectrometry in Dr. Marko Jovanovic’s lab. After completing my master’s, I continued my research in protein-protein interactions using proteomic-based methods. I joined the Jovanovic lab as a Ph.D. student in July 2024. I am interested in understanding context-dependent regulation of gene expression at the systems
level.
