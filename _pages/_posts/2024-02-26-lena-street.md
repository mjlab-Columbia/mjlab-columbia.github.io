I graduated with a B.A. from Columbia University where I worked in the Hunt lab on technologies to improve protein crystallization methods. I continued my studies at NYU where I earned a M.S. in biology in the Ercan lab, studying the mechanism of X chromosome dosage compensation in C. elegans. I joined the Jovanovic lab in May 2019 as a PhD student. I am interested in studying how RNA binding proteins regulate gene expression regulation throughout the mRNA life-cycle.
