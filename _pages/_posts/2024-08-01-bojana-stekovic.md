I graduated from University of Minnesota with a B.S. in Biology where my undergraduate research focused on uncovering novel antibiotics by exploring innovative strategies for isolating soil-dwelling microorganisms. That experience sparked my broader interest in how biological systems regulate themselves—especially at the level of gene expression. I joined the Jovanovic Lab to explore how cells fine-tune protein production through translational control. My work integrates experimental techniques with data-driven analysis. I’m currently developing my skills in mass spectrometry-based proteomics to investigate protein turnover during mitotic differentiation.
