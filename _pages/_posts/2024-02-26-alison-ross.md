I grew up in the Boston area and studied Psychology at Scripps College, where I developed an interest in the biological basis of behavior and disease. I later earned a B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of Arizona, working in Eli Chapman’s lab on small molecule screens targeting cancer-related proteins. In 2018, I returned to the East coast and joined Marko’s lab, where I primarily focused on developing mass-spectrometry based methods to measure proteome turnover in organoids and in vivo. I also piloted a proteogenomic approach to study protein-protein interactions.
