Alison B. Ross, Ph.D., is a postdoctoral researcher at Weill Cornell Medicine in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine. She earned her Ph.D. in Biological Sciences at Columbia University under the mentorship of Dr. Marko Jovanovic, focusing on proteome dynamics and translational regulation. Her doctoral work included developing technologies to monitor dynamic protein networks, contributing to the understanding of gene expression regulation. ￼ ￼

Currently, Dr. Ross is part of the Cell-of-Origin Epigenetics and Metastasis Lab led by Dr. Tan Ince at Weill Cornell, where she continues her research in proteomics and epigenetic regulation. ￼

Her notable publications include:
- Ross, A.B., Langer, J.D., & Jovanovic, M. (2021). Proteome turnover in the spotlight: approaches, applications, and perspectives. Molecular & Cellular Proteomics, 20, 100016. ￼
- Ross, A.B., et al. (2024). Systematic analysis of proteome turnover in an organoid model of pancreatic cancer by dSILO. Cell Reports Methods, 4(5). ￼

Dr. Ross’s research continues to advance the understanding of protein dynamics in cellular processes.
