I received my B.S. in Biotechnology and M.S. in Biochemistry from Yonsei University. For my masterâ€™s research in the Roe Lab, I focused on bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) proteins, working to identify a novel chemotype of BET inhibitor and applying proximity ligation techniques to reinterpret enhancer topology. I joined the Jovanovic Lab in 2025 as a Ph.D. student and am currently developing project ideas related to post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications that regulate RNA-binding protein activity. Outside the lab, I enjoy watching Broadway shows and shooting street photography on film.
