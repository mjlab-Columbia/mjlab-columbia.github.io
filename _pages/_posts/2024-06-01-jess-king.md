I graduated from Boston College with a Biology B.S. in 2021. During my undergraduate studies, I worked in the lab of Fred Winston at Harvard Medical School where I studied the relationship between mutations in the yeast transcription elongation factor Spt6 and genomic stability. After graduation, I worked as a technical research assistant in Martha Bulyk’s lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital for two years studying the binding specificity of the human Forkhead transcription factor family. I joined the Jovanovic Lab in the spring of 2024 and am interested in studying RNA-protein interactions.
