I graduated from UC San Diego with a B.S in Physiology & Neuroscience. At UCSD I worked under Dr. Timothy Gentner studying the acoustic patterns of European Starlings and Zebra Finches. During my M.S in Data Science, our team helped Dr. Bin Xu at Columbia streamline his single-cell sequencing analysis to make it more reproducible and faster. In the Jovanovic Lab I work on bioinformatics and computational analyses within the Jovanovic Lab. My focus in the Jovanovic Lab is understanding how to leverage new information from multiplexed systems level approaches.
